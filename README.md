// php code
include( "deadbeef.php" );
 
$deadbeef_linkcolor = "#0090ff";
$deadbeef_alinkcolor = "#0090ff";
$deadbeef_vlinkcolor = "#0090ff";
$deadbeef_textcolor = "#ffffff";
$deadbeef_bgcolor = "#010101";
$deadbeef_tonemap = array( array(60,20,0), array(100,100,0),
array(150,0,150), array(20, 60, 60 ) );
$deadbeef_title = "subatomicglue - secret projects";
 
echo "&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;"; 
$page_text = " 

&lt;c&gt;&lt;b&gt;centered&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/c&gt; 

&lt;r&gt;right    &lt;/r&gt; 
some text 
some text   is good to have
some text is nice to read 
&lt;l pos=32&gt;left indented 32&lt;/l&gt;
&lt;l pos=30&gt;left indented 30&lt;/l&gt;
&lt;a href="dead link"&gt;dead link&lt;/a&gt; - some dead link that doesn't work

&lt;l pos=4&gt;left indented 4&lt;/l&gt;
